# sam-cloud-resume

This repository contains the necessary code for a serverless back-end website visit counter using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and API Gateway. This has been implemented using Infrastructure as Code with AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model)

Things to still work on:
1. Github Actions to automate deployment
2. Tests

The front end code is present [here](https://github.com/sriramk42/cloud-resume-challenge). The website can be accessed at https://sriramkrishnanresume.com/
