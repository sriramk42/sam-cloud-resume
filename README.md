This repository contains the necessary code for a serverless back-end website visit counter using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and API Gateway. This has been implemented using Infrastructure as Code with AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model)

Things to still work on:
1. Github Actions to automate deployment
2. Tests
